## Closing Thoughts:

Had a fantastic week and got to talk to quite a few brillant professionals.  And whenever I get to talk with the broader development community it always leaves me feeling quite energized.  I was having a conversation with a mentee recently, and I really do encourage people to find diversity for engagement.  The key to driving impact in anything is collaboration and building relationships.  I've been in my new position for about 7 months, and if you ask me what the most important elements of my job are, they all have names.  I have been blessed to work with many brilliant people.
