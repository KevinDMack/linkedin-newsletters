## Closing Thoughts:

The speed at which the world of Software development is absolutely changing and the AI revolution has only grown over the past few years but there has been more growth in the past 3 months than in the past 2 years combined.  The saying that AI will replace traditional software engineering to me is being misinterpreted as an "AI is going to write code."  Although that's true, (and GitHub CoPilot) is amazing.  But rather the real meaning behind this is that the types of systems that are going to be built are going to look very different than what we were building 6 months ago.  

Since Cloud became a thing, the push to "Platform-as-a-service" has been a strong undercurrent.  The term "Full Stack Developer" has also been on a race to the bottom.  The idea that one person can be responsible for every single piece, component, and technology is just not sustainable.  But we've found the path through is to move things to managed solutions.  And the more this happens, the less and less of the infrastructure we want to manage.  For a lot of people, this can be scary, but for me it's very exciting.  

With the shrinking of these lower levels of the stack, the greater the opportunity that more of a developers time is spent on building out parts of the solution that actually provide value to the business.  And that is truly exciting.
