- [AI Gateway MCP and API Management in Azure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AI-Gateway) - A really great sample / lab for using API Management along with MCP for your AI solutions.  Really interesting solution and one I've only just started picking apart.  
- [generative-ai-for-beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners?WT.mc_id=academic-122979-leestott) - A great learning repo with labs for learning how to work with generative ai.  

## Interesting Links:

During this past week here's are some interesting articles / links I've found:

### Azure Government:

Here are some great news links for Azure Government:

- [Azure VM Solution IL5 Approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/azure-vmware-solution-platform-updates) - For all the DoD Customers, AvS has been approved for IL5.  

### DevSecOps:

The following are some great links in the topic of DevSecOps:

- [Github CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli) - Going along with the blog post above, a lot of people don't realize the full implications of Github CLI and actions.  The ability to create automation to support repo operations can help make your code more maintainable and readable in the future.
- [GitHub Actions workflow security analysis with CodeQL is now generally available](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-22-github-actions-workflow-security-analysis-with-codeql-is-now-generally-available/) - Fantastic security news in that CodeQL workflow actions have gone GA.  A must have for any repo to ensure security.

### AI / AI Development:

As I"ve been doing research into the development of AI, Agentic AI, and other solutions, here are some links I found:

- [Navigating fine-tuning options on Azure AI](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/navigating-fine-tuning-options-azure-ai-masha-stroganova-e704e/) - A really well written article I found for how to perform model fine tuning on Azure.  RAG is a fantastic way of handling the need to handle constantly updating data, but fine tuning is becoming more and more important as AI continues to evolve and become the center of software development.
- [LangChain Explained in 13 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywZrzNaKjs&t=38s) - I have been working lately to grow my skills in building agentic solutions.  Found this video that does a great job of explaining LangChain for a beginner like me.
- [Model Context Protocol: Introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - This article provides a great description of a open standard that is being adoptive around how you provide context to AI applications.  From this point of view, how do I load up the context for the conversation to have the appropriate relevant data to ensure accuracy in responses.  
- [GPT-4.1 model series in Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-gpt-4-1-model-series-for-azure-ai-foundry-developers/) - Always excited to see new models landing in AI Foundry to support the AI Work that developerso are doing.  
- [VSCode Running MCP using Node](https://jessehouwing.net/vscode-running-mcp-using-node-version/amp/) - I love this article cause it gives a quick way of getting MCP running in VSCode.  Seeing these tools brought directly to the IDE is encouraging.  
- [Microsoft partners with Anthropic to create official C# SDK for Model Context Protocol](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-partners-with-anthropic-to-create-official-c-sdk-for-model-context-protocol) - When I was working in space, I heard it all the time, "Python is the language of AI."  And don't get me wrong, I really do enjoy python.  The simple fact is that there is a whole world of dotnet and C# developers out there.  And seeing an SDK to support MCP with C#, and already a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ModelContextProtocol), is really encouraging.  This article does a great job laying out the opportunity and how to leverage it in your projects.  
- [LinkedIn Course - Building AI Agents with Autogen](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-ai-agents-with-autogen/let-s-build-some-ai-agents-with-autogen?u=3322) - A great course that walks through building AI agents with Autogen, and a great introduction course.  
- [Microsoft AI Learning Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/?WT.mc_id=academic-122979-leestott&tabs=developer) - A great collection of resources to learn how to develop with AI.
- [Azure AI Foundry Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq8Cq7RZM2o) - A great introduction video that explains AI Foundry in Azure.  

### Security:

Security is a constantly evolving space, especially with AI, here are some interesting articles, video and links I found:

- [Inside Look at Microsoft AI Red Team](https://www.scworld.com/perspective/an-inside-look-at-microsofts-ai-red-team) - Really interesting article talking about the red team as Microsoft focused on AI Security.  AI is moving so fast, and unfortunately things like Vibe Coding have a tendency to interject vulnerabilities.  So it's interesting to see how Microsoft is approaching this problem.  
- [Microsoft Security CoPilot Video Hub](https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/video-hub/) - A great collection of videos on the work the AI team for CoPilot are doing around cyber security. 
- [Security Pulse: A CISO Update](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/security-pulse-a-ciso-update-7320538249112801282/) - A great newsletter with a lot of really amazing insights, a must read for keeping up with security.  
- [Scurity CoPilot Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/agents-overview) - The overview documentation for the AI Agents built by Microsoft relating to Security.   

## Closing Thoughts:

During this past week, I've actually been out of the office.  And I usually try to take time when I'm off to do some more research into new skills and technologies.  The fascinating thing to me is how fast the AI landscape is constantly changing.  And this both means a lot of things to me, firstly it's exciting as it's a great time to be alive.  I've always considered myself a technologist, and from that perspective we are entering an age where people around the world are finding new and exciting ways to use these advancements to improve their productivity and lives.  

I also see a lot of fear, and I think fear can be justified here.  This is a very emerging technology, and I think it's important to temper our expectations and reliance against the quality of the results.  We are closing this gap quickly, but it's worth mentioning that AI is very much in this "trust by verify" period with regard to a lot of the elements involved.  

I also see a unique intersection here for the idea of platform engineering.  Kubernetes has largely become the defacto standard for building applications to leverage clustered compute, and I don't see this going away, because even as we build these AI models and solutions, there is still a requirement to run these solutions in a reliable and sustainable manner.  I think building architectures / platforms for organizations to host their custom AI solutions is going to be critical.  A collection of agents aren't useful if you don't have the infrastructure to run them.  

It's interesting because I was having this conversation with a colleague this past week.  While AI development is getting a lot of advancements, in a lot of ways similar challenges are still there, and need to be addressed, and with platform engineering we can bring together the learnings of Software Development with AI development.  For example, let's say you open up Azure ML and start training a model.  You can build a notebook, and do really amazing work.  But a notebook is not something that can run in a production environment and scale.  Now the good news is that you can easily take that model and wrap it in a container.  But that's only part of the solution.  You still have to worry about:

1. Deploying that container to a kubernetes cluster.
2. Securing that container, against attackers, CVEs, etc. 
3. Monitoring that container, ensuring it's working properly.
4. Monitoring the model to ensure it's behaving as expected.
5. Securing access to data sources for the model to support.
6. Tracking telemetry on the environment itself.  
7. Deploying updates to the cluster as you make changes.  

These concerns has been a part of solution development before AI, and they will exist with whatever comes next.  So I will say that these elements are still things that are part of the discussion and are critical considerations when looking at any AI project.
