# Code Workbench - Week of 5/2/2025

So I'm trying something new, and publishing an aggregation of links from my blog [code-workbench.com](https://www.code-workbench.com) for the past week, as well as some additional items.  

## Blog Posts:

The following are the key posts:

- [Using a vNext Branching Strategy - Code-Workbench](https://code-workbench.com/2025/04/25/using-a-vnext-branching-strategy/):  A blog post on how to implement a vNext focused branching strategy.  

## GitHub Updates:

The following are some notes on GitHub updates I've done recently:

- [mack-bytes-government/starter-aro-il5: Infrastructure-as-Code template for Deploying Azure RedHat OpenShift in an IL5 environment](https://github.com/mack-bytes-government/starter-aro-il5) -  - Implemented a jumpbox, bastion, and am currently working on implementing the application gateway in front of ARO.

## Interesting Links:

During this past week here's are some interesting articles / links I've found:

- [GitHub Actions workflow security analysis with CodeQL is now generally available](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-22-github-actions-workflow-security-analysis-with-codeql-is-now-generally-available/) - Fantastic security news in that CodeQL workflow actions have gone GA.  A must have for any repo to ensure security.
- [Navigating fine-tuning options on Azure AI](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/navigating-fine-tuning-options-azure-ai-masha-stroganova-e704e/) - A really well written article I found for how to perform model fine tuning on Azure.  RAG is a fantastic way of handling the need to handle constantly updating data, but fine tuning is becoming more and more important as AI continues to evolve and become the center of software development.
- [LangCHain Explained in 13 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywZrzNaKjs&t=38s) - I have been working lately to grow my skills in building agentic solutions.  Found this video that does a great job of explaining LangChain for a beginner like me.
