## Closing Thoughts:

This week was Microsoft Build, and of all the technical conferences out there, this one is my favorite.  I have long considered myself a technologist.  And by that I mean someone who is passionate about finding new technologies and new ways to solve problems with those technologies.  Build to me represents a lot more than just "Here's a bunch of announcements!"  It represents a community minded approach to evolving technology towards empowerment.  That's the part that's exciting.  I would be hard pressed to find a conference that has more of a focus around "Look what we are giving to the community!"  

I always enter and leave this week feeling really energized and empowered.  And honestly the biggest problem being that there's never enough time to investigate and work with every one of the new shiny toys that get announced.  But that's ok, and I've come to realize that the thing I value most is the feeling of being empowered and emboldened to really do more.
